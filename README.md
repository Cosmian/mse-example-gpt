# Deploy Large Language Models on MSE

> Blog post associated with this repository: [link](https://cosmian.com/protecting-privacy-in-the-age-of-chatgpt-with-cosmian-encryption/)

Example of a simple [MSE application](https://docs.cosmian.com/microservice_encryption/overview/) to perform __confidential__ inference on LLM.

The MSE app is composed of the following files:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ mse_src                   # Code folder to encrypt and deploy in the enclave
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Flask application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ggml-model-q4_0.bin   # EleutherAI/pythia-1b model weights
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python packages to install during deployment
â””â”€â”€ mse.toml                  # MSE config file
```

The example `mse.toml` is using the free hardware provided by Cosmian.
More information about config file [here](https://docs.cosmian.com/microservice_encryption/configuration/).

__Here are the steps to follow to deploy your own confidential AI app!__

## 1 - Convert a model from HuggingFace

See [convert_model](./convert_model/) for instructions.

One can also use a custom fine-tuned model converted to `GGML` format.

Finally, you should copy the resulting model file to `./mse_src`:

```bash
mse_src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ggml-model-q4_0.bin
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

## 2 - Deploy

* Install [`mse-cli`](https://docs.cosmian.com/microservice_encryption/getting_started/) on your computer.

* Test locally

```bash
$ mse test
Starting the docker: ghcr.io/cosmian/mse-flask:20230228091325...
...
[2023-06-28 14:02:01 +0000] [15] [INFO] Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000 (CTRL + C to quit)
```

* Simple text generation test

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query":"User data protection is important for AI applications since"}'
```

* Create an account on [console.cosmian.com](console.cosmian.com).

* Deploy on MSE

```bash
$ mse deploy
...
Deploying your app 'demo-mse-gpt' with 4096M memory and 3.00 CPU cores...
...
ðŸ’¡ You can now test your application: 

     curl https://$APP_DOMAIN_NAME/health --cacert $CERT_PATH
```

Keep the `url` and `certificate path` to perform requests to the MSE app.

* Simple text generation test

```bash
curl https://$APP_DOMAIN_NAME/generate --cacert $CERT_PATH
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query":"User data protection is important for AI applications since"}'
```

## 3 - Interact with your application
